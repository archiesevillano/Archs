                    I'm someone who's always fueled by curiosity and high expectations. I have a strong desire to achieve satisfaction through my endeavors, and I admit I can get a bit frustrated when things don't turn out the way I envisioned.

                    One of my greatest passions is programming. I can lose track of time, dedicating almost entire days to practicing and discovering new aspects of this craft. Yet, there are moments when I find myself getting a bit bored with web development tasks. During those times, my curiosity leads me to explore new territories or revisit hobbies I haven't enjoyed in a while.

                    Here are some of the other activities and interests that captivate me beyond the world of web programming:
                </p>
                <p className="font-quicksand">
                    Since I was a kid, I've loved editing stuff. I started at age 9, and it became my hobby. I'm really into making things look just right, especially when it comes to picking colors. I began by editing pictures online using tools like <strong>'pizap'</strong> and <strong>'pixlr.'</strong> Later, I got a laptop and learned <strong>Photoshop</strong> with my cousin, who also liked editing with it. I then moved from editing photos to editing videos using phone apps like <strong>Power Director</strong>, <strong>Viva Video</strong>, and some cool VFX apps. After that, I learned how to use <strong>Adobe After Effects</strong> and <strong>Premiere Pro</strong>. I had a blast learning all this stuff!

                <p className="font-quicksand">
                    Somewhere along the way, I stumbled upon the exciting realm of game development, and my journey led me to two incredible tools: Unity and Blender. Given my limited knowledge of 3D, I decided to begin my exploration by delving into 3D modeling using Blender. It was a fascinating journey, and I was eager to see how this newfound skill could be applied to game development through Unity.

                <p className="font-quicksand">
                    However, as life got busier, particularly with my dedication to web programming, I found myself juggling multiple pursuits. While I couldn't fully dive into C# for game development, I did manage to build a solid foundation in 3D modeling and animation. It was a rewarding experience, and even though time constraints were a challenge, I was thrilled with the knowledge I gained.

                <p className="font-quicksand">
                    Becoming a web developer made me acutely aware of the significance of assets like images, icons, and vectors in shaping the visual identity of a website. This realization sparked a new interest within me - the desire to delve into the world of logo creation and the craft of crafting visually captivating vector art. So I studied how to use <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>.

                <p className="font-quicksand">
                    I understood that these skills were not only valuable additions but also essential components of becoming a well-rounded web developer. As I ventured into logo design and the art of vector graphics, I was excited about the creative possibilities they brought to the table. These skills not only allowed me to enhance the aesthetics of the websites I worked on but also gave me the ability to craft unique and memorable visual elements that complemented the overall user experience. It's all part of my journey to be a full-fledged web developer, capable of delivering not just functional but also visually stunning online experiences.

                <p className="font-quicksand">
                    At the start of 2023, I embarked on an exciting journey by enrolling in a Fullstack Development Bootcamp. This comprehensive program went beyond web development; it delved into the realms of web design and user experience. A notable tool that became an integral part of our learning was Figma.
                </p>

                <p className="font-quicksand">
                    In our classes, we not only learned how to code but also how to visualize and design websites with precision. Figma emerged as a vital companion in this journey. We were tasked with showcasing the wireframe of our websites, and Figma's feature-rich platform proved to be a game-changer. It offered us the means to effortlessly craft visually captivating pages and interfaces that would elevate the overall user experience of our websites.
